# supervised-learning-library
A simple supervised learning library with just numpy as a dependency.

create a NN() object with the size keyword equal to an iterable that defines the network size. A network with 3 features, 4 hidden layers with 5 nodes each and 1 output layer with 2 outputs would look like:
(3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2)
(features, hidden, hidden, hidden, hidden, output)
